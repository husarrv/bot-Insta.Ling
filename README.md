# bot-Insta.Ling
A bot that allows faster resolution of sessions on the Insta.Ling platform.

On the Insta.Ling platform, the translation of words likes to repeat itself, if you come across a word that has a similar/same translation to another word, just delete the word from the "slowka.txt" file. 

Another problem may be an outdated version of "chromedriver.exe" just go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and download the appropriate version that matches the version of Chroma on your computer. Then paste file of chromedriver.exe in "/dist" folder.

If you encounter any other problems, write to me :)


Requirements:
pip install selenium | pip3 install webdriver-manager
